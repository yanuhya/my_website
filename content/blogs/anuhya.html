<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I had an amazing 4 years in college where I participated in several hackathons, took up several leadership roles in the college fest and student clubs and also went on a few trips with my friends (<em>on student budget</em>). As part of our final year thesis, we also published a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8944675">paper</a> to IEEE.</p>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p>Since graduation, I’ve been working as a software developer at Tesco ( <em>No, I don’t have coupons :P </em>), where I worked in price transformation, a key project for Tesco. We built a platform that simplified the pricing journey for the vendors, hence enabling them to set competitive prices and also improved the flexibility of pricing by 14 times. Here, I realized that my forte lies in product management - developing a product from ideation to execution excited me. Hence, MAM at LBS perfectly fit into my career aspirations.</p>
<p>Further, I worked with meet as a product management intern on “powered networking”. I am always up for a chat about product, tech and digital transformation of industries.</p>

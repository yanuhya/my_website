# Short biography

Hey everyone! I am Anuhya. I am from a city called Hyderabad in India, which is known for the biryanis. I graduated as a electronics and communications engineer in 2019 and worked as a software developer at Tesco post college.

### Education
 I had an amazing 4 years in college where I participated in several hackathons, took up several leadership roles in the college fest and student clubs and also went on a few trips with my friends (*on student budget*). As part of our final year thesis, we also published a [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8944675) to IEEE.


### Work Experience
Since graduation, I've been working as a software developer at Tesco ( *No, I don't have coupons :P *), where I worked in price transformation, a key project for Tesco. We built a platform that simplified the pricing journey for the vendors, hence enabling them to set competitive prices and also improved the flexibility of pricing by 14 times. Here, I realized that my forte lies in product management - developing a product from ideation to execution excited me. Hence, MAM at LBS perfectly fit into my career aspirations.

Further, I worked with meet as a product management intern on "powered networking". I am always up for a chat about product, tech and digital transformation of industries.
